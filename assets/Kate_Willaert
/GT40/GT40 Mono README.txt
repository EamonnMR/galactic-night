GT40 MONO FONT

An attempt to faithfully recreate the hardware character generator of the GT40, a vector graphics terminal by DEC.

This recreation is free to use for both personal and commercial projects, though I'd love if you'd email me about the finished product so I know it's getting use: kate at katewillaert dot com
