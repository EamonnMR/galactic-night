Couldn’t be simpler - it uses electrical power (which, gee I hope you have plenty, otherwise you’ve got bigger problems) to fling what we in the business call “heavy objects” in the general direction of people who you’re not too fond of. Sorry if I’m struggling to describe this thing, but hitting stuff with little bits of other stuff is a pretty bog standard offensive move, all the way down to barbarians blasting holes in each other on regressed worlds. So standard, that the whole enterprise of forcefields is pretty well dedicated to thwarting it, so while this may seem like a tempting long range option, just remember that if you’re planning on stripping shields with a bunch of these, you’re going to be spending a lot of time doing it.
