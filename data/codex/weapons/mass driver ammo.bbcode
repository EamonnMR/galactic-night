[b] Mass Driver Ammo [/b]

I should probably enjoy making these less. I mean they're just little shaped metal slugs. A lot of care went into designing the perfect grease for these though. The grease is probably doing more work than the hunks of metal, really, since the projectile needs to stay in contact with the rails.
