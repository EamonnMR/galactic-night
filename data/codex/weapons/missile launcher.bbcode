These of course go way back. Rather than generating the operating energy on-demand, you store it in little tubes. Kind of says a lot about your species that you pointed them at each other before pointing them at space. This version is unguided, but what it lacks in intelligence it makes up for in raw brute strength. There's another joke about your species in there, but I'll lay off.
