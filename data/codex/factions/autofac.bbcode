[b]Autofac[/b]

A civilization (if you can call it that) of automated factories building automated starships, rendering star systems uninhabitable all in persuit of... something? Maybe? I hope? Autofac used to be a publicly traded company before the divestitutre. Nobody will hold it against you if you repurpose their ships as scrap; they're regarded as pests at best. Many of their ships and facilities will even yield lostech which will allow you to increase your technology level.
