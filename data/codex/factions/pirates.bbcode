Their existence confounds me. Your species has been pushed utterly to the brink by the relentless expansion of an implaccable foe. And yet somehow that burning ember of violent self-interest can never be extinguished, can it? Even in the darkest times, someone's always willing to throw fists to steal one more crust of bread. Does this flaw exist inside all of you? Is it so different from the drive that created Autofac in the first place? One wonders.
