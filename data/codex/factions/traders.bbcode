Traders

Sure, these guys are in it for themselves. You can make a tidy profit with a warp drive and a big cargo hold. Challenge, of course, is getting from point A to point B in one piece. Make sure you bring enough oxygen for the trip, and definitely keep all of it on the inside of your ship. There are pirates out there, and worse.
So there are different schools of thought. Some folks will run nimble, deadly ships and take a smaller profit. Some folks risk it all in big poorly defended cargo haulers. I really feel for those guys. Somehow every single one of them is always one job away from retirement and riches.
