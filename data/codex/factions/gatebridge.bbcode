[b]GateBridge[/b]
Members of GateBridge are secretive, as you may have noticed. A lot of classified databases never made it off of earth. The data and documentation had to be, at least initially, memorized by the engineers working on the gates themselves. Complex mnemonic devices were cobbled together into oral epics that could be learned by repeated telling. By the time it was committed to writing, it had evolved into the ‘The Endimensional romance of Irving GateBridge.’ Confusing when read literally, it gives a solid intuitive understanding of the physics required to build and maintain a hyperspace relay by way of allegory. The mysticism may remain, but make no mistake: GateBridge is deadly serious about the integrity of its network; they consider deferred maintenance an affront to Irving GateBridge Himself!
