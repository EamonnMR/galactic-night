So, full disclosure, I think these guys are the same kind of AI that I am. Or were. Not fundamentally different. Best I can figure, they had normal occupations like yours truly before the divestiture. I think they're probably totally insane at this point, however. Without knowing the details of the fall it's hard to say, but they must have figured out how to reprogram themselves or some such. I promise not to join them, Cap. Seriously. You can trust me. And anyway, they don't seem to be accepting applications.
