[b]Union Rangers[/b]

When you get right down to it, the Union Rangers are a bunch of local yahoos who are trying to keep the spacelanes clear of Pirates and Autofac Drones. Even the name is a pretense, as though space were rough terrain to be ranged over. They seem to be trying their best, but judging by the number of pirate attacks whatever they're doing just isn't enough. Part of that is a symptom of the Union itself- it's a very loose alliance of planets. They'll let anyone in there except for maybe the most obvious pirate worlds.
But to their credit, if you start shooting at a trader in Union space, there's a good chance that you'll have rangers on your ass.
