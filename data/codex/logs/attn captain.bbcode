ATTN Captain

Here's the situation, Cap. Something went wrong in stasis. Probably a misjump, as it happens. Details I'm able to get about the situation in the galaxy is pretty fragmentary, but it seems like the MIC has gone from a galaxy-spanning conglomerate to an archaeological curiosity (I guess I’m what they call ‘lostech’ now.) In its place, there seems to be a [b]Pirate[/b] problem, and interstellar conflict. So if that's still the sort of problem you're interested in solving, I'm game. You're technically the highest ranking MIC officer in space now.

It seems like the divestiture from the MIC happened under circumstances that make my presence here as an AI rather awkward, as I may be the only proper one left, and group known as [b]iLisk[/b] has declared war on artificial life, though judging by radio chatter they seem just as keen to space the organic kind. You may find willing trading partners on worlds The [b]Union[/b], and as long as you stay in those safe areas, [b]Rangers[/b] should take care of any pirates you encounter until we can build a more substantial ship.

Where you go next is up to you. There are abundant resources to harvest throughout the system. You could I suppose try to find a nice world to retire to, but that isn’t our way, is it?
