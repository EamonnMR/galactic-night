While I can construct facilities to convert most obvious materials you'll find in space, some more advanced manufacturing capabilities elude me. Some technology cannot be replicated easily with the materials at hand. You will need to obtain them from [b]Autofac[/b] which seized it during the divestiture. Here's a rough guide to obtaining these materials:

I. panopticon - Delivery Drones
II. nanoforge - Fullfullment Stations
III. crucible - Harvesters
IV. hypersolenoid - Affiliate Warships
