[b]Hyperspace Telescope[/b]

This type of orbital observatory can be used to chart longer paths through hyperspace than a visible light telescope alone. And don't worry, you'll still be able to fly back in. The long jumps will show up on your map. A rather expensive way to travel, since it will also use twice the fuel, but it certainly saves time, and may help you reach otherwise isolated star systems which haven't seen the light of interstellar travel since before the divestiture.
