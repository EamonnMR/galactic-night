[b]Atinoda Lightning[/b]

Kept in production by Atinoda specifically because they don’t feel like retooling the Kestrel to carry a different type of fighter (not that you couldn't if you wanted to!) A favorite of the Union Rangers, inside or outside an escort carrier. Since these can carry a bit more supplies you’ll see Rangers flying a bit further afield in these than in Nimbuses.

It’s also got the rare distinction of being a favorite fighter of traders due to its generous cargo hold (for a fighter at least.)
