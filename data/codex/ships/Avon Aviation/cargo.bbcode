Avon Aviation Heighliner

Its very design suggests the burden of its cargo holding it down. Parts of this design are descended from prouder, more dangerous starships. The engines are solid, and they'd better be, considering how much this thing can haul. Just be careful where you go with it, pirates love to see one of these on the radar-pirates are gamblers and a Heighliner is as close as you can get in this galaxy to a sure thing.
