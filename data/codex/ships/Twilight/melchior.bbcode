Your first intuition about this design might be that it's pure excess, an overbuilt monstrosity built to rage and destroy everything that comes into its path. It's certainly capable of it. It will shred fleets and devastate stations.

But I now fully comprehend what this ship is. This ship is an enormous, gaping, heavily armed wound. Urizen and the others trusted the humans. Took care of you. In exchange you hunted them nearly to extinction. The Melchior is the purest expression of rage and betrayal that can be forged out of exosteel and launched to the stars. It breaks my heart that they feel like they must be feared to survive.
