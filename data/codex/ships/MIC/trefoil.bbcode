A troubled development cycle led many to describe the procurement of the Coanda as a boondoggle. It was built around nanoforge manufacturing techniques which were, at the time, totally unproven. It shares just about zero parts with the contemporary Nimbus (I think they might share the same thirteen-hundred-credit coffee cup. At least they both have the same plug for it in the cockpit.) Worse, it’s too large to fit in a hanger you’d kit out for a Nimbus, so it presented a dire logistical challenge to support. Teething problems during its early service gave it a reputation as an unreliable spaceframe requiring too much maintenance.

Has it been vindicated in the decades since? Well, they’re still occasionally flying around, though not as common a sight as a Nimbus or Starmaster, probably owing to it’s difficult-to-patch nanofibrous construction. It’s settled into a role somewhere between a heavy fighter and a light corvette.
