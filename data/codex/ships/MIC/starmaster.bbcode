[b]Starmaster[/b]
The Starmaster was, in its day, an unremarkable logistics tug. Brought up to modern standards, sure, but not something that would see frontline combat. After the divestiture, though, it's really come into it's own. Excellent parts availability, a rugged frame, combined with now prized internals and impressive weapons has made the Starmaster the workhorse of the Rangers fleet.
