[b]MIC Drop ship[/b]

Ducted fans, right? What are those doing on a spacecraft? This line was only adapted for space travel, it's first job was point to point transport in-atmo. They just kept upgrading the things, which speaks to their reliability. Primarily used to ferry troops to and from larger MIC vessels and stations, it's a passable utility vessel or courier. If you see a trader running one, it's probably because they found one on an old station when their other, better ship crash-docked.
