[b]MIC Erebus[/b]

I actually flew one of these. Or at least, was the AI for one of these, which of course at the time was a much more expansive role than my current one. It’s the MIC’s flagship use case for nanoforges so it required a lot of grumbling and a lot of refitting facilities, but what a ship it is.

Unlike the upgunned cargo haulers and spot-welded monstrosities you’ve probably flown up to this point, the Erebus is a true warship, designed by people with the funds to actually prosecute a space-scale conflict. What may seem generous amounts of armor, a decadent array of engines, and excessive weaponry, we just had.

Well look at that, apparently I am equipped to get mist in my virtual eyes, especially considering the fate of the tooling to make these-now those factories churn out heighliners.
