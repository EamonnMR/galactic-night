It’s from another time, but it might as well be from another universe. You may recall when these were first in the pipeline, the conversation about how many engines to strap to the thing. That third one really sells it. I’m glad the ones that got brought along with the Exodus fleet seem to have found new homes, even if many of the new owners have a taste for piracy.
