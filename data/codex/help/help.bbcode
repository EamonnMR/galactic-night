[b]Space Craft 22[/b]

In SpaceCraft 22 you find yourself in a mostly hostile galaxy.

In order to progress, you must gather resources from asteroids (gray dots on the radar) or destroyed ships. You can use gathered resources to craft stations, which in turn will let you craft new ships and weapons. Stations will persist in a system after you leave, so you can return to your base. The ships that spawn in a system (friendly or unfriendly) will depend on who controls the system; you can check the map to see. The resources in the system will depend on the biome. You can tell which biome you're in with the biomes view on the map, or by looking at the system's background color.

Venturing into AutoFac space will be dangerous, but you will be rewarded with lostech items which can be used to construct more powerful stations, ships, and weapons to defeat Autofac and save the galaxy.
