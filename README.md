# Galactic Night

Top down 2.5d space sandbox. Come for the unique perspective-in-isometric shader that mimics old school sprite graphics, stay for the blend of EV and crafting mechanics. Playable prototype.

This grew out of my attempts to replicate the look of perspective (rather than the usual isometric) rotation sprites in a 3d engine in order to have my cake (easy content pipeline with Blender and [Union Bytes Painter](https://www.unionbytes.de/apps/ubpainter/)) and eat it too (make it look and feel just like [EV Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova) the game I can't stop [cloning](https://github.com/eamonnmr/flythrough.space) in [various](https://github.com/eamonnmr/mpevmvp) ways.)
