Latest in my [long](https://github.com/eamonnmr/zond) [line](https://github.com/eamonnmr/flythrough.space) [of](https://github.com/eamonnmr/orbital_fortress) [top](https://github.com/eamonnmr/mpevmvp) [down](https://github.com/eamonnmr/surviveSpace) space demos. The 3d content pipeline of [Hovertank 22](https://github.com/eamonnmr/hovertank-22) (Blender + [Union Bytes Painter](https://www.unionbytes.de/apps/ubpainter/)) with the map mechanics of [MPEVMVP](https://github.com/eamonnmr/mpevmvp) and the item-crafting "economy" of [Survive Space](https://github.com/eamonnmr/surviveSpace) (still working on porting that stuff.) There are probably more neat features to add from there - plenty of ideas never made it into Survive Space, and I'd be interested to port more [EV Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova) features in to see how they'd jive with the more RPGish item management system.

Recently ported to the GD4 beta, which means we're using a silly quad to render the background. We're far away from any sort of launch that I'm totally ok with the instability of using a beta.
