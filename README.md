Probably misnamed at this point. Latest in my [long](https://github.com/eamonnmr/zond) [line](https://github.com/eamonnmr/flythrough.space) [of](https://github.com/eamonnmr/orbital_fortress) [top](https://github.com/eamonnmr/mpevmvp) [down](https://github.com/eamonnmr/surviveSpace) space demos. I'm planning on pulling in a bit more from Survive Space but with a nice 3D content pipeline. I'm also very interested in making perspective-looking 3d models in an orthographic world, to mimic the look of EV Nova, so a lot of the code is doing that. The rest implements an elaborite map generation system and, um, an Asteroids clone (thus the name.) I expect to port at least the functionality from SurviveSpace in.

Recently ported to the GD4 beta, which means we're using a silly quad to render the background.
