# Space Craft 22

Top down 2.5d space sandbox thing in Godot 4. Not terribly playable but very developer friendly.

This grew out of my attempts to replicate the look of perspective (rather than the usual isometric) rotation sprites in a 3d engine in order to have my cake (easy content pipeline with Blender and [Union Bytes Painter](https://www.unionbytes.de/apps/ubpainter/)) and eat it too (make it look and feel just like [EV Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova) the game I can't stop [cloning](https://github.com/eamonnmr/flythrough.space) in [various](https://github.com/eamonnmr/mpevmvp) ways.)
